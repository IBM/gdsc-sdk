        - Simple to use and understand for most users
        - Flexible enough to meet unexpected needs

        # Overview

        The `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message,
        and error details. The error code should be an enum value of
        [google.rpc.Code][google.rpc.Code], but it may accept additional error codes if needed.  The
        error message should be a developer-facing English message that helps
        developers *understand* and *resolve* the error. If a localized user-facing
        error message is needed, put the localized message in the error details or
        localize it in the client. The optional error details may contain arbitrary
        information about the error. There is a predefined set of error detail types
        in the package `google.rpc` that can be used for common error conditions.

        # Language mapping

        The `Status` message is the logical representation of the error model, but it
        is not necessarily the actual wire format. When the `Status` message is
        exposed in different client libraries and different wire protocols, it can be
        mapped differently. For example, it will likely be mapped to some exceptions
        in Java, but more likely mapped to some error codes in C.

        # Other uses

        The error model and the `Status` message can be used in a variety of
        environments, either with or without APIs, to provide a
        consistent developer experience across different environments.

        Example uses of this error model include:

        - Partial errors. If a service needs to return partial errors to the client,
            it may embed the `Status` in the normal response to indicate the partial
            errors.

        - Workflow errors. A typical workflow has multiple steps. Each step may
            have a `Status` message for error reporting.

        - Batch operations. If a client uses batch request and batch response, the
            `Status` message should be used directly inside batch response, one for
            each error sub-response.

        - Asynchronous operations. If an API call embeds asynchronous operation
            results in its response, the status of those operations should be

    protobufAny:
      description: |-
        `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer message along with a
        URL that describes the type of the serialized message.

        Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values in the form
        of utility functions or additional generated methods of the Any type.

        Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

            Foo foo = ...;
            Any any;
            any.PackFrom(foo);
            ...
            if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
              ...
            }

        Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

            Foo foo = ...;
            Any any = Any.pack(foo);
            ...
            if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
              foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
            }

         Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

            foo = Foo(...)
            any = Any()
            any.Pack(foo)
            ...
            if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
              any.Unpack(foo)
              ...

         Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

             foo := &pb.Foo{...}
             any, err := anypb.New(foo)
             if err != nil {
               ...
             }
             ...
             foo := &pb.Foo{}
             if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
               ...
             }

        The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default use
        'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the unpack
        methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last '/'
        in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield type
        name "y.z".


        JSON
        ====
        The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular
        representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an
        additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example:

            package google.profile;
            message Person {
              string first_name = 1;
              string last_name = 2;
            }

            {
              "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
              "firstName": <string>,
              "lastName": <string>
            }

        If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON
        representation, that representation will be embedded adding a field
        `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type`
        field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

            {
              "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
              "value": "1.212s"
            }
      example:
        value: value
        type_url: type_url
      properties:
        type_url:
          description: |-
            A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of the serialized
            protocol buffer message. This string must contain at least
            one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path must represent
            the fully qualified name of the type (as in
            `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in a canonical form
            (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).

            In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary all types that they
            expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for URLs which use the
            scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally set up a type
            server that maps type URLs to message definitions as follows:

            * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.
            * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a [google.protobuf.Type][]
              value in binary format, or produce an error.
            * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on the
              URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
              lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
              on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
              breaking changes.)

            Note: this functionality is not currently available in the official
            protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning with
            type.googleapis.com.

            Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme) might be
            used with implementation specific semantics.
          type: string
        value:
          description: Must be a valid serialized protocol buffer of the above specified

    protobufFieldMask:
      description: |-
        paths: "f.a"
            paths: "f.b.d"

        Here `f` represents a field in some root message, `a` and `b`
        fields in the message found in `f`, and `d` a field found in the
        message in `f.b`.

        Field masks are used to specify a subset of fields that should be
        returned by a get operation or modified by an update operation.
        Field masks also have a custom JSON encoding (see below).

        # Field Masks in Projections

        When used in the context of a projection, a response message or
        sub-message is filtered by the API to only contain those fields as
        specified in the mask. For example, if the mask in the previous
        example is applied to a response message as follows:

            f {
              a : 22
              b {
                d : 1
                x : 2
              }
              y : 13
            }
            z: 8

        The result will not contain specific values for fields x,y and z
        (their value will be set to the default, and omitted in proto text
        output):


            f {
              a : 22
              b {
                d : 1
              }
            }

        A repeated field is not allowed except at the last position of a
        paths string.

        If a FieldMask object is not present in a get operation, the
        operation applies to all fields (as if a FieldMask of all fields
        had been specified).

        Note that a field mask does not necessarily apply to the
        top-level response message. In case of a REST get operation, the
        field mask applies directly to the response, but in case of a REST
        list operation, the mask instead applies to each individual message
        in the returned resource list. In case of a REST custom method,
        other definitions may be used. Where the mask applies will be
        clearly documented together with its declaration in the API.  In
        any case, the effect on the returned resource/resources is required
        behavior for APIs.

        # Field Masks in Update Operations

        A field mask in update operations specifies which fields of the
        targeted resource are going to be updated. The API is required
        to only change the values of the fields as specified in the mask
        and leave the others untouched. If a resource is passed in to
        describe the updated values, the API ignores the values of all
        fields not covered by the mask.

        If a repeated field is specified for an update operation, new values will
        be appended to the existing repeated field in the target resource. Note that
        a repeated field is only allowed in the last position of a `paths` string.

        If a sub-message is specified in the last position of the field mask for an
        update operation, then new value will be merged into the existing sub-message
        in the target resource.

        For example, given the target message:

            f {
              b {
                d: 1
                x: 2
              }
              c: [1]
            }

        And an update message:

            f {
              b {
                d: 10
              }
              c: [2]
            }

        then if the field mask is:

         paths: ["f.b", "f.c"]

        then the result will be:

            f {
              b {
                d: 10
                x: 2
              }
              c: [1, 2]
            }

        An implementation may provide options to override this default behavior for
        repeated and message fields.

        In order to reset a field's value to the default, the field must
        be in the mask and set to the default value in the provided resource.
        Hence, in order to reset all fields of a resource, provide a default
        instance of the resource and set all fields in the mask, or do
        not provide a mask as described below.

        If a field mask is not present on update, the operation applies to
        all fields (as if a field mask of all fields has been specified).
        Note that in the presence of schema evolution, this may mean that
        fields the client does not know and has therefore not filled into
        the request will be reset to their default. If this is unwanted
        behavior, a specific service may require a client to always specify
        a field mask, producing an error if not.

        As with get operations, the location of the resource which
        describes the updated values in the request message depends on the
        operation kind. In any case, the effect of the field mask is
        required to be honored by the API.

        ## Considerations for HTTP REST

        The HTTP kind of an update operation which uses a field mask must
        be set to PATCH instead of PUT in order to satisfy HTTP semantics
        (PUT must only be used for full updates).

        # JSON Encoding of Field Masks

        In JSON, a field mask is encoded as a single string where paths are
        separated by a comma. Fields name in each path are converted
        to/from lower-camel naming conventions.

        As an example, consider the following message declarations:

            message Profile {
              User user = 1;
              Photo photo = 2;
            }
            message User {
              string display_name = 1;
              string address = 2;
            }

        In proto a field mask for `Profile` may look as such:

            mask {
              paths: "user.display_name"
              paths: "photo"
            }

        In JSON, the same mask is represented as below:

            {
              mask: "user.displayName,photo"
            }

        # Field Masks and Oneof Fields

        Field masks treat fields in oneofs just as regular fields. Consider the
        following message:

            message SampleMessage {
              oneof test_oneof {
                string name = 4;
                SubMessage sub_message = 9;
              }
            }

        The field mask can be:

            mask {
              paths: "name"
            }

        Or:

            mask {
              paths: "sub_message"

    rpcStatus:
      description: |-
        - Simple to use and understand for most users
        - Flexible enough to meet unexpected needs

        # Overview

        The `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message,
        and error details. The error code should be an enum value of
        [google.rpc.Code][google.rpc.Code], but it may accept additional error codes if needed.  The
        error message should be a developer-facing English message that helps
        developers *understand* and *resolve* the error. If a localized user-facing
        error message is needed, put the localized message in the error details or
        localize it in the client. The optional error details may contain arbitrary
        information about the error. There is a predefined set of error detail types
        in the package `google.rpc` that can be used for common error conditions.

        # Language mapping

        The `Status` message is the logical representation of the error model, but it
        is not necessarily the actual wire format. When the `Status` message is
        exposed in different client libraries and different wire protocols, it can be
        mapped differently. For example, it will likely be mapped to some exceptions
        in Java, but more likely mapped to some error codes in C.

        # Other uses

        The error model and the `Status` message can be used in a variety of
        environments, either with or without APIs, to provide a
        consistent developer experience across different environments.

        Example uses of this error model include:

        - Partial errors. If a service needs to return partial errors to the client,
            it may embed the `Status` in the normal response to indicate the partial
            errors.

        - Workflow errors. A typical workflow has multiple steps. Each step may
            have a `Status` message for error reporting.

        - Batch operations. If a client uses batch request and batch response, the
            `Status` message should be used directly inside batch response, one for
            each error sub-response.

        - Asynchronous operations. If an API call embeds asynchronous operation
            results in its response, the status of those operations should be
            represented directly using the `Status` message.

        - Logging. If some API errors are stored in logs, the message `Status` could
            be used directly after any stripping needed for security/privacy reasons.

        code: 0
